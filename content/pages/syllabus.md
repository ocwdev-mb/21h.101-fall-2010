Requirements
------------

### Attendance and Participation

Class attendance, completion of the readings by the class in which they will be discussed, and participation in discussions. Normally the class will discuss the assigned portion of the textbook and the issues it raises on Tuesday and the other readings assigned for the week on Thursday.

### Assignments

Completion of two papers, due in Week #4 and Week #11. Suggested topics based on assigned readings are listed on the {{% resource_link b05befdf-bf0d-5331-5050-9a28963e39bb "Assignments" %}} page. Students can also write on other topics, particularly for the second paper, but must have the topics approved by the instructor before the date they are due. Papers should be about five to seven pages long. They must be typed, double-spaced, with adequate margins for comments and corrections. Any document-based research paper must include notes and bibliography, and all papers must provide page citations for direct quotations.

### Exams

A midterm examination will be given in Week #7 and a final examination during finals week.
